#Enziteto Beamer Theme

Enziteto is a work in progress as a beamer theme I use for my
keynotes. It was previously known as _lacamliscio_.
Its main purpose is to provide a minimalistic beamer theme in which
the information hierarchy is rendered mainly through typographic features.

A special thanks goes to Michele Bozzi and Marika Mastrandrea who
contributed to the initial design of the theme and provided very
insightful advices on the layout.

##Requirements
In order to use enziteto you will need:

- [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) as a
  decent open source sans serif font
- [XeLaTeX](http://www.xelatex.org/) to compile LaTeX sources with
custom fonts

##Install
Run `make install` and then `make reload` (this last command may need
admin privileges) to copy the `.sty` files to your tex-mf dir.

##Examples
To compile the examples into pdfs, `cd` into the examples dir and run `make`.
